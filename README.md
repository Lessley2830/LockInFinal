# LockIn

Lockin is a app that we created for are user to stay focus and on task.where I worked with a team to code different screens and help with the design. The goal was to create an engaging and interactive game that was both functional and visually appealing.
# My Contributions
As a coder I was responsible for programming the game’s screens and assisting with design. I worked closely with the team to support each other.
# What I Learned
This was my first big project at the Apple Devloper Academy, and I was nervous about how it would go. But over time, I realized it’s okay to face difficulties and that asking my team for help is part of the learning process. I felt frustrated at times, but I also felt proud of the progress I made. The whole experience helped me build my confidence and improved my ability to work collaboratively.
I learned so much about coding and how to balance design with functionality. This experience was really valuable in helping me grow both technically and personally, especially when it came to working in a team. At the beginning, the challenge was tough because I was just getting back into coding which lead me to fell a bit overwhelmed at times but with perseverance and the help of my team we managed to collaborate and get really far with the challenge.
