# LandMarkDash 

LandMarkDash is a game based on Detroit, where players travel around the city to visit historical landmarks, learn about Detroit's history, and collect mementos like popular snacks and souvenirs from the area. I worked as a coder on the project and was part of a team. We all worked together to help with coding, design, and other parts of the game. Our main goal was to create a fun and engaging experience, which we achieved by collaborating and using each other's strengths.
# My Contributions
As a coder, my main responsibility was to write the code to make sure the game ran smoothly. I also helped with the design, offering ideas to make the game look appealing and easy to play. Working on both coding and design helped me learn and grow in both areas.
# What I Learned
This project taught me a lot about coding, design, and the importance of teamwork. I learned how crucial it is to communicate, collaborate, and support each other to overcome challenges. The project had its ups and downs, but in the end, we came together, solved problems, and created something we were really proud of. It was a great opportunity to improve my skills and work with a talented team.
